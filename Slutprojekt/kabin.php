                    There is more to greater comfort in SAS Business than just the fantastic new seats. You can relax here, savor delicious meals with our new service concept onboard & sleep comfortably. Enjoy the extra leg room or stretch out on a fully flat bed. You can also work effectively or take advantage of our new on-demand entertainment system & free WiFi. During spring 2016 we start rolling out telephony onboard, allowing you to call and use your mobile from the air. Connection via the standard GSM - like on vacation where you pay the tariff under international charges to your telephone operator.

The bedding (blankets, pillows & mattress) comes from Hästens, the oldest bed manufacturer in Sweden, & we guarantee you a good night's sleep. Our Business customers can experience Hästens products on all SAS long-haul flights.
